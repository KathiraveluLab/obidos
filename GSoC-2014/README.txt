Data Replication / Synchronization Tools
-----------------------------------------

My contributions for Google Summer of Code 2014 is committed to the code repository of Emory BMI at [1]. Though multiple branches were created at [2] as a tag for major developments or checkpoints, all the code changes have been merged to the master branch, and hence it is the master branch that should be checked out, at all the moments.
